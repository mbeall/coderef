#### Programming languages are more similar than they are different.

This is the approach of CodeRef, and the reference pages are built with this in mind.

### CodeRef __is__:

- A resource for developers
 - Developers who know how to read code can use this website as a quick reference</p>
- Concise
 - No "fluff" here, just straight to the point.
- Full of illustrative code examples
 - This site often uses examples of code to illustrate something as opposed to prose or graphics.
- A work in progress
 - This site is currently incomplete and changing. While not entirely appropriate, let's say it is in alpha.

### CodeRef is __not__:

- A site for beginners
 - If you are learning how to code, this site is not necessarily for you.
- An exhaustive documentation site
 - This site does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to extensive documentation for specific languages, however, when available, links for this type of documentation is provided.
- A forum or example site
 - This site doesn't hold the answer to solve a specific application's problem.
